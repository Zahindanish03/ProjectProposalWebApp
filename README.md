Title of The Project: "NOMNOMBite" -- A web application for food ordering and restaurant management.

Introduction of the Proposed Web Application: NOMNOMBite is a web-based food ordering system developed using Laravelâ€™s Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
                                              The application focuses on providing a clean, user-friendly, and Shariah-compliant platform for ordering Halal-certified meals from registered local restaurants. 
                                              It empowers both restaurant owners and customers to manage menus, place orders, and track deliveries with ease.

Objective: - To provide a Shariah-compliant food ordering platform that focuses on Halal-certified restaurants.
           - To enable customers to browse menus, place online orders, and track order statuses.
           - To allow restaurants to manage food items, orders, and delivery statuses efficiently.
           - To implement Laravel components such as routing, Blade views, Eloquent models, and CRUD operations.

Features and Functionalities: - **User Authentication:** Role-based login for Admin, Restaurant Owner, and Customer.
                              - **Restaurant Dashboard:** Add, update, and delete food items with images and prices.
                              - **Customer Dashboard:** Browse menus, add items to cart, place orders, and view order history.
                              - **Order Management:** Real-time updates of order status (Pending, Preparing, Out for Delivery, Completed).
                              - **Responsive UI:** Built with Laravel Blade and Bootstrap for mobile and desktop support.
